# My Research Journey

As a PhD student at the University of Auckland, I'm passionate about making software engineering more inclusive and accessible to developers with diverse cognitive styles.

## The Problem

Software engineering tools and practices are often designed with a "one-size-fits-all" approach. However, developers have different cognitive styles, problem-solving approaches, and ways of thinking. This can create barriers for some developers and limit the potential of our field.

## My Approach

My research uses the **GenderMag method** to evaluate and improve the cognitive inclusivity of software engineering tools. GenderMag helps identify usability issues that disproportionately affect users with certain cognitive styles.

### Key Research Questions

1. How do different cognitive styles affect debugging experiences?
2. What barriers exist in current development tools?
3. How can we design more inclusive tools and practices?

## Early Findings

Through my work on newcomers' debugging experiences, I've found that:

- Cognitive diversity significantly impacts how developers approach problems
- Current tools often favor certain cognitive styles over others
- Small design changes can make big differences in inclusivity

## Looking Forward

I'm excited to continue this work and contribute to making software engineering more welcoming and effective for everyone, regardless of their cognitive style.

Stay tuned for more updates on my research!
