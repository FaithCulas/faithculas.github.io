## Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive study on newcomers' experiences during debugging tasks, examining how cognitive diversity affects problem-solving approaches. Using the GenderMag method, we analyze the inclusivity of debugging tools and practices. Our findings reveal significant variations in how different cognitive styles approach debugging challenges, highlighting the need for more inclusive tool design. The study provides actionable recommendations for improving debugging experiences for developers with diverse cognitive profiles.
