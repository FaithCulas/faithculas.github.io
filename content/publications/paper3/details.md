## Abstract
This research explores the cognitive load experienced by developers during various programming tasks. Using eye-tracking and think-aloud protocols, we measure cognitive load across different task types including code comprehension, debugging, and feature implementation. Our results show that cognitive load varies significantly based on code complexity, familiarity with the codebase, and task type. We propose design guidelines for reducing cognitive load in development environments.
